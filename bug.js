This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library in conjunction with react-native-web.  The issue arises because the ImagePicker component from Expo relies on native modules, which are not available in the web environment.  When attempting to use ImagePicker on a web platform, the application either crashes or the picker does not function correctly.  This leads to unpredictable behavior and prevents users from selecting images on the web version of the application.
